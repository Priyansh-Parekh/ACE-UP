This project is a web-based digital storefront inspired by the Epic Store, allowing users to browse, purchase, and download games. It features agame listings, and secure transactions. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the platform aims to provide a seamless user experience while implementing essential e-commerce functionalities.

our main objectives:

    ✅    1. we have to make sure when user come to our webpage we will pop up  a page for login
    ✅    2. after login we will give them some amount of Gcash to spend it in our store
    ✅    3. if user clicks on filter button we will pop up a page where many filters are available
          4. if user clicks on support button we will redirect him to our support page
    ✅    5. if user clicks on cart we will redirect him to cart page
    ✅    6. if user clicks on whishlist we will redirect him to wishlist page
           7. if user clicks on G-Vault we will redirect him to page where he is able to see all his purchased games
    ✅    8. there is a big block on web page that screen will show top 5 games one by one in some time interval
    ✅    11 that games will also be shown on right side of that big block
    ✅    12.then we will show other games behind it
    ✅    13.we will give some class to all games so it will be easy to use filter button
    ✅     14. by clicking on any game we will redirect him to page of that game
           15. there will be many options such as to purchase game and to add cart etc
    ✅     16. On Clicking the Buy Button our G-Cash should be Reduced!
           17.We will create a page which will get redirected when G-cash is over and we will allow to restore it's cash by real payment interference
           18.if user clicks on Cart,Wishlist button then that particular game should be shown on Cart and Whislist Page
